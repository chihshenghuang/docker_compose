    "readme": "# `react-test-renderer`\n\nThis package provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.\n\nEssentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the \"DOM tree\" rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom.\n\nUsage:\n\n```jsx\nconst ReactTestRenderer = require('react-test-renderer');\n\nconst renderer = ReactTestRenderer.create(\n  <Link page=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</Link>\n);\n\nconsole.log(renderer.toJSON());\n// { type: 'a',\n//   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },\n//   children: [ 'Facebook' ] }\n```\n\nYou can also use Jest's snapshot testing feature to automatically save a copy of the JSON tree to a file and check in your tests that it hasn't changed: https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html.\n",
